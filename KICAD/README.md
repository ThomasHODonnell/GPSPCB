# Kicad Files

## *This folder contains files needed to open / edit this project in KICAD.* 

- I'll use these files to provide screenshots from the IMAGES folder for your entertainment!
- This file could also be considered as a BOM, but i'll leave out component prices as they fluctuate frequently. 
- The PCB should be finished with production within the next week or so (7/27/23), after which I will upload real images of the device.

### **PCB Schematics**
- I will only show a screenshot of the Front Copper layer, as all of the components are located on this layer. 
- If interested, I welcome a detailed review of the PCB design through the direct file found in this folder. 
- DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT EMPLOYED BY PROTECTION AUTOMATED. I am interested in entrepreneurship in the future. 
If testing proves that a version of this product could become viable, I wanted to label the project as that businesses prototype.
