# Datasheets 
  

- This file contains all of the datasheets for components in this file. 
- I based the vast majority of my design decisions on information found in these files. 
- In addition, there may be datasheets of additional parts not used in the design. 
  - When facing the component selection stage, I downloaded component datasheets that I suspected may be of use to me. 
  - Not all of these components are used, but I found their datasheets to provide helpful context information for similar parts I used. 
  - So, I kept them here for future reference.
